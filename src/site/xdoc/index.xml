			<subsection name="Disclaimer">
				<p>
					Apache AWF is an effort undergoing incubation at
					<a class="externalLink" href="http://apache.org/">The Apache
						Software Foundation</a>
					(ASF), sponsored by the
					<a class="externalLink" href="http://incubator.apache.org/">Apache Incubator PMC</a>
					Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a
					further
					review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and
					decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with
					other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not
					necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the
					code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully
					endorsed
					by the ASF.
