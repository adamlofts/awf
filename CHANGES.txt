0.4.0
 * Renaming org.apache.web.http.client.{HttpRequest.java -> Request.java} and
   org.apache.web.http.client.{HttpResponse.java -> Response.java}.
 * o.d.io.timeout.Timeout.newKeepAliveTimeout now requires that you specifies an ioloop explicitly (previously the 
   global singleton was used implicitly.)
 * AsynchronousSocket no longer accepts SelectableChannel. Instead SocketChannel is used.
 * AsynchronousSocket's read methods (readUntil and readBytes) returns raw byte[] instead of String. (DEFT-115)
 * RequestHandler implementations are now configured through annotation (DEFT-100).
 * Package renamed "org.apache.deft", from "org.deftserver" (DEFT-157).

0.1.1
 * #56 (Support for all response status codes)
 * #55 (Don't set Etag response header if payload is empty)
 * #54 (Make parsing of HttpRequest more robust) 
 * #61 (Wrong 'Cache-Control' header in SCH)
